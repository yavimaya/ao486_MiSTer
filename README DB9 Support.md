A new option has been added in the main menu of this core called: "UserIO Joystick" to activate joysticks 
Mega Drive/Genesis (DB9MD) or Neo-Geo/Supergun (DB15). This feature is disabled by default, therefore you
must enter the menu for the first time to activate it and save.

For total control from the UserIO Joysticks (also the OSD menu) is necessary to update the files 
MiSTer and menu.rbf from the root of the SD card. 

Menu DB9 controls buttons:  Start+C-> Show OSD menu  |  A-> Enter  |  B-> Esc
